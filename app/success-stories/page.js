              After spending four years as a finance executive, Catherine
              realized that her passion extended beyond numbers and
              spreadsheets. In 2021, she decided to challenge herself by
              venturing into the tech world, starting with YouTube tutorials on
              coding. However, she soon recognized the value of a structured
              learning path and a supportive community, which led her to
              Codetrain. The transition wasn‚Äôt easy‚Äîbalancing family, work, and
              coding required late nights and lunch break assignments‚Äîbut her
              determination kept her going. Now proficient in frontend
              development and working on projects like an insurance app,
              Catherine feels fully prepared to launch her tech career. The
              journey not only sharpened her technical skills but also
              transformed her mindset, fostering collaboration, continuous
              learning, and a deep appreciation for the power of community at
              Codetrain.
