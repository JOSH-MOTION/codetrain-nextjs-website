      "Korkor Mensah’s journey into tech began with an unexpected challenge. When she couldn’t assist her kids with their coding bootcamp assignments despite her IT experience, the embarrassment motivated her to enroll in Codetrain herself. Balancing family obligations and a full-time job in a fast-paced environment was challenging, but Korkor’s dedication never wavered—she never missed a class or assignment. Her hard work paid off with a promotion and significant growth in her professional network and online visibility. Inspired by her progress, Korkor is now a passionate advocate for coding, encouraging her children to pursue it with the same enthusiasm.",
